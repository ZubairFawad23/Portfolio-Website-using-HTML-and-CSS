Further, the page should include a section that present projects that you have been part of in a list, and/or similar sections with work experience, and courses and educational institutions attended.

you should be able to include on your page(s): 1. All web pages will only be "linked" to a single stylesheet at any point in time, but it must work properly (without any changes other than to the link element) with both stylesheets.
2. A nav bar with a few links that either navigate to other pages or act as anchor tags.
3. A heading to signal something important or declare a new section/paragraph.
4. A couple paragraphs describing the amazing things you want to share. Remember to use emphasis on key words!
5. A list of key things to know about something in your paragraph. Why not do an ordered list and unordered list?
6. An image of something relevant and visually appealing. You can store your image as an asset in your project folder or link back to the source on the web. The link should be clickable, but the image doesn't need to be.
7. A footer at the bottom of the page declaring your copyright on such a wonderful write-up, and make sure you use the copyright symbol!
